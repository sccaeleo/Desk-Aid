            As a new district office staff person, we understand that you may not know how to process various constituent requests or what resources are available for the constituent. The Constituent Services Desk Aid aims to help you through the initial learning curve by giving you step-by-step instructions for many of the most common services including PennDOT, Property Tax/ Rent Rebate, senior benefits, LIHEAP, and welfare questions.

            Many times this desk aid will direct you to call a departmental legislative liaison. When this happens, please refer to the list of legislative liaisons in this guide. You can visit the House Democratic SharePoint site (pahofr.sharepoint.com) or contact District Operations and Outreach (DO&O)for the most recent list of liaisons. In other cases the desk aid will direct you to contact the Constituent Services Office at 717-783-4529 or constituentservices@pahouse.net. This refers to the House Democratic Constituent Services Office. They are often the best resource when it comes to PennDOT issues and birth/death certificates requests.

            Use this aid as starting point for developing your own, district-specific,guidelines for how to best serve your constituents. Seek out local resources, take notes, and make new diagrams if need be. If you have any questions or feedback, please contact DO&O at 717-705-2062 or outreach@pahouse.net
